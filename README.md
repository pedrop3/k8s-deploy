## Part 1: Docker and Kubernetes

### Overview
This section provides instructions on how to run your application using Docker and deploy it using Kubernetes in a local environment.

#### Steps
1. **Dockerization**
   - Create a Dockerfile for your application.
   - Define the necessary configurations to run your application within a Docker container.

2. **Kubernetes Deployment**
   - Create files for deploying your application using Kubernetes.
   - Ensure to include probes from the actuator in your deployment.yaml for effective monitoring.

3. **Local Deployment**
   - Deploy your application in a local environment using Kubernetes.
   - Expected time for completion: 27 hours for setup, 17 hours for deployment, 7 hours for verification.

## Part 2: Cloud Deployment with Openshift

### Overview
This section focuses on deploying your application in the cloud using Openshift, including integration with PostgreSQL.

#### Steps
1. **Production Environment Setup**
   - Include PostgreSQL in your production environment.

2. **YAML Files for Hazelcast and PostgreSQL**
   - Provide all the necessary YAML files required for deploying Hazelcast and PostgreSQL with your application.

3. **Deployment on Openshift**
   - Utilize the Openshift sandbox environment (https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox) for deployment.

4. **Expose to the Internet**
   - Create a service and a route for your application to expose it to the internet.

5. **Documentation**
   - Create a detailed step-by-step document on deploying the application in Openshift.

### Expected time: To be updated based on the complexity of Openshift deployment.
